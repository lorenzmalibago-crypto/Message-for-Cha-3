    <h1>For You</h1>
    <p>
      (Final Part) Spoiler alert! Yeah, it was me hahaha. I’ve been the one behind this from the start.  
      I wanted to make something special, something a little different from just words on chat or a random note.  
      I know I’m not always the best with expressing things face-to-face, but I thought this could be one way to let it all out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just want you to know that you’re really important to me. I don’t always say it, but I notice the little things,  
      and I’m really grateful for you—your presence, the way you make things lighter even when they’re tough,  
      and how you’ve unknowingly inspired me in so many ways. I admire you a lot, more than I can probably explain here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know life gets messy sometimes, and not everything goes the way we want it to,  
      but please remember that I’ll always be rooting for you. Whether you notice it or not,  
      I’ll be in your corner, cheering you on quietly. You’ve got so much ahead of you,  
      and I truly believe you’re capable of reaching it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And maybe, just maybe, this is also me being a little selfish—wanting you to know that you matter to me,  
      that I care a lot more than I let on. You’ve become someone I’ll always look forward to,  
      someone I don’t ever want to lose. That’s the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, I’ll stop before this turns into a full novel hahaha.  
      But yeah… this is me, telling you straight, even if it’s hidden behind a page like this.  
      Thank you for being you. Thank you for everything, really.
    </p>
